### 💫 About Me
I'm a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, Python, React.js, Flask, and REST APIs. With a background in user-centered roles, I bring excellent communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills to every team and project.

🔐 I recently built **[BiteFinder](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/pt75-group1-final)** — a restaurant discovery and reservation platform with features like secure JWT authentication, dynamic filtering, and responsive UI design.

💡 I thrive in fast-paced, remote environments and am always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on meaningful software solutions that improve people's lives.
